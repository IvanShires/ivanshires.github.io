        <p>I'm a guy who loves to build cool stuff and have fun doing it. Throughout my career, I've been fortunate to work alongside and learn from a lot of awesome people with diverse experience, working together to manage massive networks and some of the fastest computers in the world. When I’m not tackling a new data center project, you’ll probably find me contributing to open-source projects, traveling, or out on the ice playing hockey.</p>
